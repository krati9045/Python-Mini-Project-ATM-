    "   Automated Teller Machine enables the clients of a bank to have access to their account without going to the bank.\n",
    "   Security is the foundation of the good ATM sysytem. This system will provide secure transactions between users and the bank      servers. The whole process will be automated right from PIN validation to transaction completion.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   To develop this ATM system the entire operation has been divided into the following step:\n",
